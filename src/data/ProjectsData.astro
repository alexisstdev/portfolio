  <p>This software solution is designed to automate and streamline large-scale queries within the SOIA system.</p>
  <p><strong>What is SOIA?</strong> The Sistema de Operación Integral Aduanera (SOIA) is a centralized platform managed by Mexican customs authorities to facilitate and monitor import/export operations. It provides access to customs-related information, including shipment statuses, pedimento details, container tracking, and more.</p>
  <p>The module addresses a critical pain point for companies relying on the SOIA system: inefficiency and lack of scalability. The existing manual query process is often slow, tedious, and limited to one record at a time, making it impractical for managing large datasets or frequent requests.</p>
  <p>To overcome these challenges, this solution leverages automated scraping to extract and process data from the SOIA system efficiently.</p>
  <p>Previously, manually querying a dataset of 100 records could take nearly 2 hours of continuous effort. With this solution, thousands of queries can be processed in minutes, operating seamlessly in the background and saving hundreds of hours of manual work.</p>
